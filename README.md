# react-project-set-up-boilerplate

This is a base setup to start developing a react project with parcel. This project is open source, so please feel free to fork and adapt for your own projects. Happy Coding!

**Whats Included**

1. prettier
2. eslint
3. parcel
4. react and jsx

You dont need .babelrc file as Parcel transpiles your code with @babel/preset-env by default. Also, does not require @babel/preset-react as parcel supports .jsx automatically.

For Development build,

```shell
npm run dev
```

For production build,

```shell
npm run build
```
